## ✨ Emotional Thesis
**Feels like a handwritten letter left by the fireplace — honest, warm, and gently hopeful.**  
Every visual, word, and motion should convey three truths:
1. You are safe.  
2. You are seen.  
3. You have time to love again.

## 🎨 Color System

| Role | Hex | RGB | Emotion |
|------|-----|-----|----------|
| **Primary** | `#B06F47` | 176, 111, 71 | Copper — warmth, trust, hearthlight |
| **Secondary** | `#6B7B6A` | 107, 123, 106 | Sage — calm, renewal, balance |
| **Background** | `#FAF3ED` | 250, 243, 237 | Ivory — safety, intimacy |
| **Text Primary** | `#3B2E2A` | 59, 46, 42 | Depth, maturity |
| **Text Secondary** | `#7B6A63` | 123, 106, 99 | Subtle contrast |
| **Accent (Highlight)** | `#E8C39E` | 232, 195, 158 | Hope, affection |

**Usage**
- Ivory + copper = default emotional baseline.  
- Sage used in reflective and calm states.  
- Avoid pure black or white — always slightly tinted tones.  
- Transitions between colors should fade softly, not jump.

## 📐 Spacing & Layout

- **Philosophy:** Feels like reading an elegant memoir — linear, flowing, never crowded.
- **Grid:** 8pt baseline, but apply freely for organic flow.
- **Max Width:** 720px single-column focus zone.
- **Margins:** 32–48pt sides, 24pt internal padding.
- **Dividers:** soft 1px lines in muted copper or paper-gray.
- **Card Corners:** rounded 12–16px; shadows diffuse (not directional).
- **Whitespace:** is emotional — each section should breathe.

**Photography Frames**
- Gentle vignette edges.
- Warm light filter (`#E8C39E` overlay at 5–10% opacity).
- Never stock-perfect — always candid, real, human.

---

## 🖼 Photography & Imagery

**Subjects:** Real adults 45–65 — diverse, authentic, unretouched.  
**Contexts:** reading nooks, gardens, kitchens, quiet city walks, art studios.  
**Lighting:** natural, warm, late-afternoon or candlelight.  
**Composition:** editorial minimalism — emotional realism over polish.  
**Mood:** “This could be me — and I’d feel safe here.”  

**Imagery Dos**
- Golden hour light, natural laughter, gentle movement.
- Subtle blur backgrounds for intimacy.
- Show touch — hands, glances, gestures — not glamour.

## 🎞 Motion & Interaction

| Type | Duration | Behavior | Tone |
|------|-----------|-----------|------|
| **Page transition** | 250–300ms | Soft fade | Calm and cinematic |
| **Verification success** | 300ms | Warm ember glow | Reassuring |
| **Reflection card reveal** | 400ms | Slow fade + handwritten quote motion | Reflective |
| **New message** | 200ms | Gentle fade, no sound | Peaceful |
| **Button hover** | 150ms | Subtle lift and copper tint | Inviting |

**General Rules**
- Never bounce or slide abruptly.
- Motion mimics breath — slow in, slow out.
- Use microinteractions sparingly; each should affirm safety or warmth.

## 💬 Voice & Tone

**Core Voice:**  
Modern romanticism — emotionally literate, intelligent, and kind.  

| Context | Example |
|----------|----------|
| **Welcome** | “You’ve lived, loved, and learned — that’s your story.” |
| **Verification** | “Trust begins when we show up as ourselves.” |
| **Profile Creation** | “Your words are more powerful than any swipe.” |
| **Reflection Prompt** | “What kind of connection would feel nourishing today?” |
| **Match Intro** | “Someone whose story resonates with yours awaits.” |
| **Error Message** | “That didn’t go through — let’s take another moment.” |

**Principles**
- Speak to the heart, not the ego.  
- Use active compassion (“You’re doing great — no need to rush”).  
- Replace urgency with reassurance.  
- Never use exclamation marks or gamified feedback.  

---

## 🧩 System Consistency
- **Typography, color, and motion** must reinforce calm trust.  
- **Microcopy, pacing, and layout** must always reflect emotional maturity.  
- **Design anchor:** Apple Human Interface + Linear calm minimalism + editorial romance.  
- Each touchpoint must say, “You are safe enough to hope again.”

---

## ♿ Accessibility
- 16–18pt minimum body text.  
- 4.5:1 contrast ratio or higher.  
- Keyboard and screen-reader support.

## 🧠 Emotional Audit Checklist
1. Does this screen feel **intimate yet confident**?  
2. Do colors and type evoke calm and warmth?  
3. Would a mature adult feel **seen, not sold to**?  
4. Does every transition breathe rather than rush?

---

## 🧰 Technical QA Checklist
- Line height and rhythm match 8pt grid.  
- Contrast meets AA+.  
- All interactive states distinct and perceivable.  
- Motion under 400ms unless cinematic moment.  
- No inaccessible color blends.

## 🪞 Design Integrity Review
Hearth’s system blends classic editorial romance with digital kindness.  
Copper, ivory, and sage form its emotional triad: trust, safety, and renewal.  
Typography feels handwritten, personal, and timeless.  

**Suggested refinement:**  
Introduce an optional “Night Mode” with deep cocoa background (`#3B2E2A`) and ivory text for bedtime reflection, maintaining warmth while easing the eyes.
