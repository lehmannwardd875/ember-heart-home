## 🧭 Design Metaphor Summary
**Hearth = Home.**  
Every page should feel like:
- **A safe room:** soft lighting, quiet space, warm materials.  
- **A slow fire:** gentle motion, lasting warmth, steady energy.  
- **A handwritten letter:** authentic, unhurried, deeply human.

## 💡 Closing Note
Every journey through Hearth must follow one emotional law:  
**“You are safe enough to hope again.”**  
If any page breaks that feeling — it doesn’t belong.
